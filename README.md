# D3.js-Mini-Challenges

Mini Challenges with D3.js

Clone this repository and finish up all the TODO challenges in each files.


## Notes for Amy 

- For code consistency and best practice let's follow a code style. We make all of the students follow the AirBNB style guide. The tutorials should follow it also.
- The first couple pieces of the tutorial have only trivial data. The whole tutorial should use meanigful data. The earlier part of the class uses the Titanic dataset you can use that. 
- The insturctions need a little more direction. Make the first challenge super easy. 
- We need some stretch challenges. These would harder challenges that will challenge advanced students. 
- Don't use inline JS. It's not best practice. Use addEventListener instead
- Name the files to make it clear what order they should be done. 
- SVG challenges might be a good place to work in some abstrct challenges
	- make the goal learning svg elements like:
		- circle
		- rect
		- oval
		- line
	- Cover attributes like:
		- r - radius 
		- stroke
		- stroke-width
		- width
		- height 
		- cx, cy 
		- x, y
- Break up challenges into several smaller challenges each a single task. 
- Use three lab projects
